# Sid-Cup Family Landing Page

- I took a Reference from Sheryians Coding School.
- I used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and GSAP in this project.
- It is a fully animated landing page.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of modern web technologies to create a dynamic and visually appealing user experience. By leveraging the power of HTML5 and CSS3, I have crafted a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The backbone of the web page, providing a structured and semantic framework.
- **CSS3**: Utilized for styling and layout, including advanced features like Flexbox and Grid for a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented to add interactivity and enhance user engagement through DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: Used to create smooth and performant animations, bringing the landing page to life with dynamic transitions and effects.

This project is a testament to my skills in web development and my commitment to creating high-quality, user-centric web applications. Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions.
